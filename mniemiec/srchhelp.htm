<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This page contains four independent search engines, each used for a different
purpose:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><a class="j" href="#pat">Search for pattern</a> lets you search for one
	or more patterns that match search criteria. A list of matching
	patterns is produced, and for each matching pattern found, many
	details about the pattern are displayed.</li>
    <li><a class="j" href="#still">Search for still life</a> lets you search for
	a still-life or difficult still-life in Life by its index number.
	For each still-life found, the synthesis can be displayed, if
	available.</li>
    <li><a class="j" href="#cat">Search Catagolue</a> lets you search Catagolue
	by any search criteria Catagolue supports.</li>
    <li><a class="j" href="#rule">Search for rule</a> lets you search for
	outer totalistic or non-totalistic rules, and converts between RLE
	rule strings, neighborhood descriptions, and Golly rule tables.</li>
</ul></p>
</article>
<hr class="a" /><article><a id="a1" name="a1"></a>
<a id="pat" name="pat"></a>
<h2>Search for pattern</h2>
<p>Search for pattern is the primary focus of this page. It lets you search
for patterns using a wide variety of criteria. To perform a search, select
search criteria in the table at the top, press the <em>Search</em> button,
then examine the search results below. Selecting a pattern from the search
results displays details about the pattern, and shows the pattern image.</p>
<p>The top section contains one line, <b>Add constraint:</b>, with five
drop-down lists containing constraints to use to qualify the search. These
are:</p>
<p><ul>
   <li><a class="j" href="#check">CHECKS</a> for selections determined by check
	boxes or multiple-selection drop-down lists.</li>
   <li><a class="j" href="#common">COMMON</a> for common numeric
	measurements.</li>
   <li><a class="j" href="#uncommon">UNCOMMON</a> for less common numeric
	measurements.</li>
   <li><a class="j" href="#boxes">BOXES</a> for bounding box numeric
	measurements.</li>
   <li><a class="j" href="#text">TEXT</a> for textual (non-numeric) criteria,
	including search by pattern image or glider number.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The bottom section contains options that affect result display. Altering
any of these after a search has been performed will have an immediate effect
on the displayed results, without needing to perform a new search. Changes
to any other constraints will not take effect until a new search is
actually performed (although enabling or disabling search criteria may also
affect which columns are shown in the result table).</p>
<p><ul>
    <li id="by"><b>Show results by:</b> lets you choose to see the matched
	patterns by List, which shows a text table with one row per pattern, or
	by Stamp Page, which shows the patterns in a graphical table, like the
	patterns on other pages on this site. The Stamp view is more readable,
	but the List view provides much more information, and can show more
	results at once if large objects are involved. The default is List.</li>
    <li><b>Show tool tips</b>, when checked, shows tips about all controls and
	result fields on this page, by hovering the mouse over them for a few
	seconds. This is turned off by default.</li>
    <li><b>Maximum results:</b> When viewing results by list, this limits the
	number of results shown per page. This defaults to 20.
	<span id="fixed">(The maximum number of views displayed on the stamp
	view depends on the size of the largest result pattern and the
	<em>Stamp zoom</em> factor. This can be up to 10&times;11 for &times;4
	zoom, 13&times;15 for &times;3 zoom, 20&times;23 for &times;2 zoom, and
	41&times;46 for &times;1 zoom.)</span></li>
    <li><b>Stamp zoom:</b> When viewing results by stamp page, this sets the
	zoom factor to &times;1, &times;2, &times;3, or &times;4.
	The default is &times;4</li>
    <li><b>Sort results by:</b> lets you choose the order to view the results.
	By default, this is by ascending population, then period, then name.
	The default criteria are also used to sort patterns within each matching
	group. If search results are displayed in a list, the criterion used for
	sorting is also displayed in the list.</li>
    <li><b>Show number as:</b> lets you choose what format to display numbers.
	(e.g. the same number shows as 1.5 under Decimal, 3/2 under Rational,
	and 1&frac12; under Mixed). Integers are always just displayed as
	integers (e.g. 42). Irrational numbers always use decimal format.
	Numbers too large to display always use scientific notation, e.g.
	1.25e10. Velocity is always shown as rational, if possible regardless
	of this setting.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The sections inbetween show selected criteria. For convenience, the most
common constraints (Rule, Category, Period, and Minimum population) are
pre-selected, as they are the most frequently used. Each criterion has a check
box to the left; if that check box is un-selected, the criterion is removed.
Note that irrelevant criteria are hidden, even if they are selected (e.g.
if the Category criterion is set to only search for still-lifes, Heat,
Modulus, Period, Slope, and Velocity are all irrelevant, so they are hidden
and ignored).</p>
<p>Below the criterion table is a control bar with the following controls:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><b>Search</b>: Pressing this starts a new search using the selected
	criteria.</li>
    <li><b>Reset</b>: Pressing this resets all criteria on the page to their
	defaults.</li>
    <li><b>Help</b>: Pressing this launches this help page. This can also be
	done at any time by pressing the F1 key.</li>
    <li>The search status and search result summary is displayed on the right.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The search normally takes one or two seconds. If you specify a particularly
broad search that can find thousands of matches (e.g.
<em>Pattern name: Contains &ldquo;e&rdquo;</em>, to find all patterns whose names
contain the letter &ldquo;e&rdquo;), the search can take considerably longer,
and may trigger a browser warning about a slow or unresponsive script.
Please be patient.</p>

<h3>Check</h3>
<p>This section includes constraints that are specified by check boxes or
drop-down lists.</p>
<p><b>Category</b> specifies which category or category of patterns to search
for:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><em>Any</em> finds all patterns.</li>
    <li><em>Still-life</em> finds still-lifes: stationary objects with a period
	of 1.</li>
    <li><em>Pseudo-still-life</em> finds pseudo-lifes: stationary pseudo-objects
	with a period of 1.</li>
    <li><em>Quasi-still-life</em> finds quasi-lifes: stationary quasi-objects
	with a period of 1.</li>
    <li><em>Oscillator</em> finds oscillators: stationary objects with periods
	&gt;1.</li>
    <li><em>Pseudo-oscillator</em> finds pseudo-oscillators: stationary
	pseudo-objects with periods &gt;1.</li>
    <li><em>Quasi-oscillator</em> finds quasi-oscillators: stationary
	quasi-objects with periods &gt;1.</li>
    <li><em>Spaceship</em> finds spaceships: objects with non-zero
	velocities.</li>
    <li><em>Pseudo-spaceship</em> finds pseudo-spaceships: pseudo-objects with
	non-zero velocities.</li>
    <li><em>Quasi-spaceship</em> finds pseudo-spaceships: quasi-objects with
	non-zero velocities.</li>
    <li><em>Wick-stretcher</em> finds wick-stretchers: growing objects with a
	non-zero velocity and a linear growth rate, that produce a fixed number
	of ever-growing objects.</li>
    <li><em>Puffer</em> finds puffer trains: growing objects with a non-zero
	velocity and a linear growth rate, that produce an ever-increasing number
	of fixed-size objects.</li>
    <li><em>Gun</em> finds guns: stationary growing objects with a linear growth
	rate, that produce an ever-increasing number of moving objects.</li>
    <li><em>Breeder</em> finds breeders: objects with a super-linear growth
	rate.</li>
    <li><em>Constellation</em> finds constellations: collections of separated
	objects and pseudo-objects. Quasi-objects are a subset of these.
	Most constellations involve still-lifes and oscillators, but a few also
	include spaceships.</li>
    <li><em>Methuselah</em> finds methuselahs: small unstable objects that evolve
	for a long time before finally settling down.</li>
    <li><em>Multiple&hellip;</em> brings up a small pop-up window that allows
	you to select multiple categories.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>If your search can include still-lifes, checking <em>Difficult?</em> includes
only those still-lifes in the 14&hellip;18-bit range from the
difficult-to-synthesize list (i.e. those that were determined by the expert
system to not have trivial syntheses based on existing conversion recipes).
All of these still-lifes have since been found to have syntheses, and additional
recipes have since been added; however, for numbering purposes, these lists have
not been changed.)</p>
<p>Checking <em>Multiple colors</em> only includes patterns that have
multi-color syntheses in multi-color Life.</p>
<p>Checking <em>Multiple files</em> only shows patterns that have two or more
synthesis files. This can happen in one of three circumstances:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Some very large (or difficult to synthesize) objects may have multiple
	syntheses separated into different files, or a single synthesis split
	into multiple parts.</li>
    <li>Many methuselahs that produce large results, especially those that
	release multiple gliders, have one file showing multiple syntheses,
	and another containing only one, that allows the methuselah to be run
	to completion without multiple copies interfering with each other.</li>
    <li>Some patterns have additional properties that are best illustrated in a
	separate file (e.g. the Queen bee&rsquo;s ability to eat gliders in many
	different ways).</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Checking <em>Multiple pattern names</em> shows only patterns that are known
by two or more different listed names. This frequently happens for larger
still-lifes that have descriptive names as well as their numeric designations.
It also happens frequently for common objects that are independently discovered
or named by different people.</p>
<p>For period 2 oscillators, <b>P2 rotor</b> selects the kind of rotors
that are matched:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><em>Flip-flop</em> shows only oscillators whose rotor cells die only
	from under-population.</li>
    <li><em>On-off</em> shows only oscillators whose rotor cells die only
	from over-population.</li>
    <li><em>Either</em> shows both flip-flops and on-offs.</li>
    <li><em>Not flip-flop</em>, <em>Not on-off</em>, and <em>Neither</em>
	reverse these searches.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Phoenix</b> selects patterns based on their survivability:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><em>Phoenix</em> shows only patterns that have no cells that survive
	(e.g. Life patterns that would work in a rule <em>B3/S</em>), such as
	oscillators with no stator cells. In some non-Life rules (e.g. B2/S2),
	there are also spaceships that are phoenixes.</li>
    <li><em>Not Phoenix</em> shows only patterns that are not phoenixes.</li>
    <li><em>Any</em> includes all patterns.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>When searching for oscillators, <b>Raging river</b> selects the rotor
size:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><em>Raging river</em> shows only oscillators whose rotors are
	completely contained in a 2&times;<i>n</i> rectangle.</li>
    <li><em>Not raging river</em> excludes raging rivers.</li>
    <li><em>Any</em> shows both kinds of oscillators.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>When searching for oscillators, <b>Rotor</b> selects the rotor
shape:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><em>Babbling brook</em> shows only oscillators whose rotor consists
	entirely of a single open-ended chain of cells.</li>
    <li><em>Muttering moat</em> shows only oscillators whose rotor consists
	entirely of a single closed-ended chain of cells.</li>
    <li><em>Either</em> shows both of the above.</li>
    <li><em>Not babbling brook</em>, <em>Not muttering moat</em>, and
	<em>Neither</em> exclude oscillators of the above types.</li>
    <li><em>Any</em> shows all kinds of oscillators.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Rule</b> is a drop-down list that selects the rule whose patterns
are searched:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><em>B3/S23</em> (Life) is the most popular rule, and the one that has
	the most patterns on this site. This is the default.</li>
    <li><em>B2/S2</em> and <em>B34/S34</em> are explosive totalistic rules.</li>
    <li><em>B36/S23</em> (HighLife) is another widely studied rule very similar
	to Life.</li>
    <li><em>B36/S245</em> (Replicator rule) is rule with a small replicator.</li>
    <li><em>B3/S238</em> (EightLife), <em>B38/S23</em> (Pedestrian Life), and
	<em>B38/S238</em> (Honey Life) are rules that are almost identical to
	Life.</li>
    <li><em>Niemiec0&hellip;Niemiec5</em> are a group of related non-totalistic
	rules that include several small common spaceships, puffers, and
	replicators.</li>
    <li><em>Any</em> includes patterns from all of the above rules.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>(Note that when searching for a pattern image, if a RLE pattern is entered
and contains a rule specification, that rule overrides any rule specified in
this section.)</p>
<p><b>Symmetry</b> qualifies patterns by what kind of symmetry they
possess:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><em>C1</em> selects patterns that have no symmetry.</li>
    <li><em>C2</em> selects patterns that have 180&deg; rotational
	symmetry around a point, but have no other symmetry.</li>
    <li><em>C4</em> selects patterns that have 90&deg; rotational
	symmetry around a point, but have no other symmetry.</li>
    <li><em>C2|4</em> selects both of the above.</li>
    <li><em>C4 D8</em> selects patterns that have 90&deg; rotational
	symmetry around a point, and may also be reflected in an axis.</li>
    <li><em>C2|4 D4|8</em> selects patterns that have 180&deg; rotational
	symmetry around a point, and may or may not also have 90&deg;
	rotational symmetry and/or be reflected in an axis.</li>
    <li><em>D2_+</em> selects patterns that are reflected in an
	orthogonal axis, but have no other symmetry.</li>
    <li><em>D2_x</em> selects patterns that are reflected in an
	diagonal axis, but have no other symmetry.</li>
    <li><em>D2</em> selects both of the above.</li>
    <li><em>D4_+</em> selects patterns that are reflected in two
	orthogonal axes, but have no other symmetry.</li>
    <li><em>D4_x</em> selects patterns that are reflected in two
	diagonal axes, but have no other symmetry.</li>
    <li><em>D4</em> selects both of the above.</li>
    <li><em>D2|4|8_+</em> selects patterns that are reflected in one or two
	orthogonal axes, and perhaps also in both diagonal axes.</li>
    <li><em>D2|4|8_x</em> selects patterns that are reflected in two
	diagonal axes, and perhaps also in both orthogonal axes.</li>
    <li><em>D2|4|8</em> selects patterns that are reflected in two
	axes, and perhaps also in both other axes.</li>
    <li><em>D4|8_+</em> selects patterns that are reflected in two
	orthogonal axes, and perhaps also in both diagonal axes.</li>
    <li><em>D4|8_x</em> selects patterns that are reflected in two
	diagonal axes, and perhaps also in both orthogonal axes.</li>
    <li><em>D4|8</em> selects patterns that are reflected in two
	axes, and perhaps also in both other axes.</li>
    <li><em>C2|4 D2|4|8</em> selects patterns that have at least one
	point or axis of symmetry.</li>
    <li><em>Any</em> selects all patterns, even those without symmetry.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>In all of the above except <em>C1</em> and <em>D2_x</em>, these must also be
qualified by whether the point or axis of symmetry passes through the center of
a cell (1), an edge between two cells (2), or the corner between four cells (4).
You can select one or more of these, or <em>Any</em> to allow all of them.</p>
<p><b>Glide symmetry</b> qualifies patterns by what kind of glide
symmetry they possess. Glide symmetry occurs in oscillators and
spaceships that appear rotated or reflected before returning to
their original orientation.</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><em>C1</em> selects patterns that have no glide symmetry.</li>
    <li><em>C2</em> selects patterns that have 180&deg; rotational glide
	symmetry around a point, but have no other glide symmetry.</li>
    <li><em>C4</em> selects patterns that have 90&deg; rotational glide
	symmetry around a point, but have no other glide symmetry.</li>
    <li><em>C2|4</em> selects both of the above.</li>
    <li><em>D2_+</em> selects patterns that get reflected in an
	orthogonal axis, but have no other glide symmetry.</li>
    <li><em>D2_x</em> selects patterns that get reflected in an
	diagonal axis, but have no other glide symmetry.</li>
    <li><em>D2</em> selects both of the above.</li>
    <li><em>C2|4 D2</em> selects patterns with any glide symmetry.</li>
    <li><em>Any</em> selects all patterns, even those without glide
	symmetry.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>In all of the above except <em>C1</em> and <em>D2_x</em>, these must also be
qualified in the same way Symmetry is qualified. The same qualifier is used for
both. This is also necessary if both Symmetry and Glide Symmetry are D2_x.</p>

<h3>Common</h3>
<p>This section includes common numeric constraints.</p>
<p>Numeric constraints have a drop-down list indicating the kind of comparison
to perform against an property (e.g. population, period, etc.). Most of these
comparisons also require a numeric parameter on the left (<i>y</i>), and a
few also require a numeric parameter on the right (<i>x</i>).
The following comparisons are available:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><b>Any</b>: no constraint is applied. This is the default.</li>
    <li><b>= <i>y</i></b>: the property must exactly equal <i>y</i>.</li>
    <li><b>&ne; <i>y</i></b>: the property must be anything except
	<i>y</i>.</li>
    <li><b>&lt; <i>y</i></b>: the property must be less than but not
	equal to than <i>y</i>.</li>
    <li><b>&le; <i>y</i></b>: the property must be less than or equal to
	<i>y</i>.</li>
    <li><b>&gt; <i>y</i></b>: the property must be more than but not
	equal to <i>y</i>.</li>
    <li><b>&ge; <i>y</i></b>: the property must be more than or equal to
	<i>y</i>.</li>
    <li><b><i>x</i> &ndash; <i>y</i></b>: the property lie within the range
	bracketed by numbers <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> inclusive (i.e.
	<i>x</i> &le; property &le; <i>y</i> or <i>x</i> &ge; property &ge; <i>y</i>).</li>
    <li><b><i>x</i> ~ <i>y</i></b>: the property must not lie within the range
	bracketed by numbers <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> inclusive.</li>
    <li><b>&infin;</b>: the property must be infinite (same as = _).</li>
    <li><b>?</b>: the property must be unknown (same as = ?).</li>
    <li>(In cases where special values like &infin; or <em>Unknown</em> (?)
	can occur, these can be directly selected from the selection list
	without having to type them in manually).</li>
</ul></p>
<p>A few additional ones are also available for Cost in gliders:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><b>Known</b>: a synthesis is known to exist, but the exact number of
	gliders has not yet been computed.</li>
    <li><b>Unknown</b>: no synthesis is currently known (same as &ge; x).</li>
    <li><b>Partial</b>: a partial synthesis is known (same as &gt; x).</li>
    <li><b>TBD</b>: the information about whether or not syntheses for this
	object is known or not has not yet been added to the database.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Any field where you need to enter a number gives you great flexibility in
entering one. You may enter any of the following:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>An empty field is treated as the default value (which is
	usually zero, except for some mathematical operators
	like multiplication and division).</li>
    <li>Integers (e.g. 1), real numbers (e.g. 1.5), or
	scientific notation (e.g. 1.5e6).</li>
    <li>Special fractions &frac14; &frac12; and
	&frac34; mixed numbers like 1&frac12;.</li>
    <li>Infinity, by typing _ or &infin; or
	<em>infinity</em>.</li>
    <li>Some mathematical constants (<i>e</i>, <i>&pi;</i>,
	<i>&tau;</i>, <i>&straightphi;</i>).</li>
    <li>For unknown values, such as gliders for objects without
	synthesis, frequency or rarity for uncommon objects,
	or heat for extremely large spaceships, enter <em>?</em>
	or <em>x</em> or <em>unknown</em>. (Partial syntheses
	can be specified by forms like <em>x+2</em>.)</li>
    <li>Some simple algebra is allowed (e.g. <i>x</i>+2, 1e6-1, 2<i>&pi;</i>
	or 2*<i>&pi;</i> or 2&times;<i>&pi;</i>, 2/3, 3&divide;4, <i>&pi;</i>^2
	or <i>&pi;</i>&sup2;, &radic;2, 3&radic;10, 3!).</li>
    <li>You can also enter multiple numbers separated by
	semicolons. With = the numbers are joined with
	<em>or</em> (e.g. <em>= 1;2;4</em> means
	<em>is 1 or 2 or 4</em>). With any other comparison
	type, the numbers are joined with <em>and</em> (e.g.
	<em>&ne; 1;2;4</em> means
	<em>is not 1, and is not 2, and is not 4</em>).
	Specifying multiple numbers for anything other than =
	or &ne; is not likely to be useful (e.g.
	<em>&lt; 1;2;3</em> is the same as
	<em>&lt; 1</em>).</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Gliders</b> selects the minimum number of gliders needed to synthesize
the pattern. You can also select <em>Unknown</em> for patterns with no known
syntheses, <em>Partial</em> for patterns with simple syntheses based on an
as-yet-unsynthesized predecessors, and <em>TBD</em> for patterns for which
syntheses are planned, but have not yet been attempted, so their synthesis
status is not yet known. You can also select <em>Known</em> for patterns for
which syntheses have not yet been attempted, but it has been proven that
syntheses definitely exist using standard techniques.</p>
<p><b>Gliders/bit</b> selects the relative cost in gliders, i.e. number
of gliders divided by minimum population. (This is treated as the same as
the number of gliders in cases when the number of gliders is unknown,
i.e. Unknown, Partial, TBD, or Known). Other pages on this site take
particular interest of patterns for which this value =1 or &gt;1.</p>
<p><b>Modulus</b> selects a modulus that should be matched. This is usually
the same as period, but may be period/2 for patterns with glide symmetry, and
may also be period/4 for asymmetric patterns with 90&deg; rotational glide
symmetry. You can also qualify by the ratio of modulus to period.</p>
<p><b>Period</b> selects the pattern&rsquo;s repetition period. This is the
minimum number of generations that it takes for the pattern to return to its
original state. The meaning varies, depending on the pattern type:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Still-lifes, pseudo-still-lifes, and quasi-still-lifes always have a
	period of 1, so this criterion is ignored when only searching for
	them.</li>
    <li>Oscillators, pseudo-oscillators, and quasi-oscillators return to their
	original state.</li>
    <li>Spaceships, pseudo-spaceships, and quasi-spaceships return to their
	original state, translated in space.</li>
    <li>Constellations contain multiple copies of the above, and are
	treated similarly.</li>
    <li>Guns return to their original state, but also release spaceships.</li>
    <li>Puffers and wick-stretchers return to their original state, translated
	in space, and leave behind periodic debris such as still-lifes,
	oscillators, or spaceships.</li>
    <li>Breeders return to their original state, possibly translated in space,
	and leave behind growing debris such as guns, puffers, or
	wick-stretchers.</li>
    <li>Methuselahs are unstable and aren&rsquo;t periodic, so they have no periods.
	For search purposes, however, measurements of their period and other
	oscillating properties (such as modulus, heat, volatility, bounding
	box, etc.) are measurements of those properties for their final
	census.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Population (min.)</b> selects patterns based on their minimum population
or range of populations. If a pattern has multiple phases with different
populations, the lowest population is used for search purposes, and is
also the criterion used on the rest of this site for categorizing objects by
population. For growing patterns, such as guns, puffers, wick-stretchers, and
breeders, this is the population of their first recurring state, before they
have produced any output.</p>
<p><b>Population (max.)</b> selects patterns based on their maximum population
or range of populations. If a pattern has multiple phases with different
populations, this is the population of the largest phase. Growing patterns like
guns, puffers, wick-stretchers, and breeders have infinite maximum populations.
The maximum population of methuselahs is defined as the population of the
largest phase of its final census.</p>
<p><b>Population (avg.)</b> selects patterns based on their mean population or
range of populations. If a pattern has multiple phases with different
populations, this is the mean population of all phases. Growing patterns like
guns, puffers, wick-stretchers, and breeders may have infinite average
populations. The average population of a methuselah is defined as the mean of
the populations of all phases of its final census.</p>
<p><b>Population (min./max.)</b> selects patterns based on the ratio of
minimum to maximum population. This will be 0 for infinitely growing patterns,
and 1 for still-lifes, including the empty field.</p>
<p><b>Slope</b> selects moving patterns based on their slope of movement.
These vary from 0 for orthogonal movement to &frac12; for diagonal movement.
It is not defined for non-moving patterns, and is ignored for them.</p>
<p><b>Velocity</b> selects patterns based on their velocities or range of
velocities. Velocities are described as fractions of <i>c</i> (the speed of light).
Spaceships, pseudo-spaceships, quasi-spaceships, puffers, and wick-stretchers
have non-zero velocities. Still-lifes, pseudo-still-lifes, quasi-still-lifes,
oscillators, pseudo-oscillators, quasi-oscillators, and methuselahs have
zero velocities. Constellations and breeders can be either. For non-zero
velocities, you can also select a specific direction, or search all
directions. (This is basically the same as selecting Slope, but is simpler.)
Velocity is always measured along the major axis of movement; e.g. an oblique
(2,1)<i>c</i>/6 spaceship would be indicated by 2<i>c</i>/6, or more simply, <i>c</i>/3.)</p>

<h3>Uncommon</h3>
<p>This section includes less common numeric constraints.</p>
<p><b>Active rotor cells</b> is the number of cells in an oscillator that
change. This is zero for still-lifes. It is infinite for moving and growing
patterns. For pseudo-objects, quasi-objects, and constellations, this is the
sum of the number of rotor cells in the component objects. For methuselahs,
this is the number of active rotor cells in the final census.</p>
<p><b>Density (min/)</b> is the ratio of minimum population and and influence.
This is always between 0 and 1. In Life, this is always less than &frac12;.</p>
<p><b>Density (max.)</b> is the ratio of maximum population and and influence.
This is always between 0 and 1.</p>
<p><b>Density (avg.)</b> is the ratio of average population and and influence.
This is always between 0 and 1. In Life, this is always less than &frac12; for
still-lifes and period 2 oscillators.</p>
<p><b>E.F.</b> (Evolutionary Factor) is the ratio of T.T.S. (Time to
Stabilize) to minimum population. This is non-zero only for unstable
patterns (e.g. methuselahs).</p>
<p><b>Frequency</b> is the relative number of times an objects occurred in
Achim Flammenkamp&rsquo;s random soup experiments. It is 1/rarity. Except for a
small number of common objects, most objects have frequencies of 0. This only
applies to still-lifes and oscillators in the Life rule; all other categories
are considered to have frequencies of <em>N/A</em> for search purposes.</p>
<p><b>Heat</b> is the average number of unstable cells. It is zero for
still-lifes, and can be infinite for growing patterns. For methuselahs, this is
the heat of the final census.</p>
<p><b>Influence</b> is the number of cells in a pattern&rsquo;s area of
influence. A cell is within a patterns area of influence it is is living cell
at any time during any of the pattern&rsquo;s phases, or is ever adjacent to
any of a pattern&rsquo;s living cells. This is infinite for moving or growing
patterns. For methuselahs, this is the influence of the final census.</p>
<p><b>Number of rotors</b> is the number of distinct disjoint rotors in an
oscillator. This is 0 for still-lifes. This is 1 for basic oscillators, although
in some cases e.g. Tumbler) two adjacent rotors interact without touching.
For pseudo-objects, quasi-objects, and constellations, this is the sum of
the number of rotors in the component objects. For methuselahs, this is the
number of rotors in the final census.</p>
<p><b>Rarity</b> is the inverse of Frequency. Except for a small number of
common objects, most objects have infinite rarity. This only applies to
still-lifes and oscillators in the Life rule; all other categories are
considered to have rarities of <em>N/A</em> for search purposes.</p>
<p><b>Temperature</b> is the ratio of heat to the number of active rotor cells.
This is always between 0 and 1 inclusive. It is defined for moving and growing
patterns, even though those have infinite temperature and active rotor
cells.</p>
<p><b>Time to stabilize (T.T.S.)</b> is the number of generations it takes
the pattern to reach a periodic form. This is non-zero only for unstable
patterns (e.g. methuselahs) and is measured from their smallest form.</p>
<p><b>Volatility</b> is the number of active rotor cells divided by the
minimum population. This always varies between 0 for still-lifes and 1 for
phoenixes. This is also 1 for moving and expanding patterns.</p>
<p><b>Volatility (strict)</b> is similar to Volatility, except only rotor
cells whose period is the same as that of the whole pattern are considered.
This always varies between 0 and the volatility.</p>
<p><b>Volatility (relative)</b> is the ratio of Strict volatility to
Volatility. This always varies between 0 (for patterns with pseudo-periods,
e.g. with two independent rotors of different periods), and 1 (for patterns
with non-trivial rotors, and all patterns whose periods are prime or 1).</p>

<a id="boxes" name="boxes"></a>
<h3>Boxes</h3>
<p>This section includes bounding boxes.</p>
<p><b>Box (hull)</b> selects the bounding box that includes all generations.
This is similar to the largest box, but may be slightly larger, and can be
infinite for moving and growing patterns.</p>
<p><b>Box (largest)</b> selects the largest bounding box the pattern fits
in. For growing patterns (e.g. guns, puffers, wick-stretchers, and
methuselahs that release gliders), this can be infinite. For methuselahs,
this is the largest box achieved once the pattern stabilizes.</p>
<p><b>Box (smallest)</b> selects the smallest bounding box the pattern fits
in. For patterns with multiple generations (e.g. oscillators and spaceships),
this may not necessarily be the size of the box in the pattern with the
smallest population.</p>
<p><b>Rotor box</b> is the size of the box that completely encloses all the
rotor cells in a pattern. This is defined for oscillators. It is zero for
still-lifes. For pseudo-objects, quasi-objects, and constellations, it is
defined as the smallest box that encloses the rotors in all the component
objects. For methuselahs, this is defined based on the final census.</p>
<p>Each of the above categories has six separate properties:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><b>Width</b> is the length of the shorter dimension.</li>
    <li><b>Height</b> is the length of the shorter dimension.</li>
    <li><b>Area</b> is the area of the box, i.e. width &times; height.</li>
    <li><b>Circumference</b> is the circumference of the box, i.e.
	2 (width + height).</li>
    <li><b>Diagonal</b> is the length of the diagonal, i.e.
	&radic;(width&sup2; + height&sup2;).</li>
    <li><b>Squareness</b> is the ratio of height/width. It varies from 0
	for patterns that grow infinitely in one direction, to 1 for
	square patterns.</li>
</ul></p>

<a id="text" name="text"></a>
<h3>Text</h3>
<p>This section includes constraints that are specified by text strings
rather than numeric values.</p>
<p>Most of these include a drop-down list:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><em>Any</em> ignores this constraint.</li>
    <li><em>Is</em> matches the whole name.</li>
    <li><em>Begins with</em> matches the beginning of the name.</li>
    <li><em>Ends with</em> matches the end of the name.</li>
    <li><em>Contains</em> matches any part of the name.</li>
    <li><em>Does not begin with</em>, <em>Does not end with</em>, and
	<em>Does not contain</em> are similar, but they exclude all
	patterns whose names match as above, rather than include them.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Names can contain wildcards &mdash; a ? matches a single character, while a
* matches any number of characters. A * at the beginning of a name is the same
as <em>Ends with</em>, a * at the end of a name is the same as
<em>Begins with</em>, and a * at both ends is the same as <em>Contains</em>.
Multiple names can be separated by , or ; to indicate <em>or</em>.
A ~ between names means <em>and not</em>, and at the front means <em>not</em>.
For example, <em>Is &ldquo;~*jam*&rdquo;</em> is the same as
<em>Doesn&rsquo;t contain &ldquo;jam&rdquo;</em>, and
<em>Contains &ldquo;snake~block~boat&rdquo;</em> means
<em>Contains &ldquo;snake&rdquo; but neither &ldquo;block&rdquo;
nor &ldquo;boat&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p><b>APG name</b> allows for searching for a pattern by its canonical
apgcode, as used by apgsearch and Catagolue. This is well defined for
still-lifes, oscillators, and spaceships. It is also well defined for
pseudo-objects, quasi-objects, and constellations containing these,
although apgsearch and Catagolue currently do not track them. This is
not defined for constellations containing patterns of different
velocities, or methuselahs. There is also a definition that covers
patterns with linear growth (e.g. guns, puffers, and wick-stretchers),
but this only describes the pattern&rsquo;s growth signature, rather than
the pattern&rsquo;s image, so it is not necessarily unique. Because it is
difficult to compute, it is provided for all puffers and guns in the
pattern collection, but is not computed for patterns that are entered
manually. APG names contain lower-case letters, digits, and underscores.
All other punctuation is ignored.</p>
<p><b>File name</b> allows for searching by a pattern&rsquo;s file name.
This is always a name from 1-8 characters long, containing digits,
hyphens, and lower-case letters. It usually begins with a number,
that is the minimum population, except in cases of growing patterns
(e.g. guns, puffers, wick-stretchers, and breeders). Letter case is
ignored. Other punctuation characters are ignored. If a path or extension
is given, it is ignored (e.g. searching for <em>/directory/5gl.rle</em>
will search for the name <em>5gl</em>.</p>
<p><b>Glider number (all)</b> allows for searching for specific gliders in
David Eppstein&rsquo;s glider repository, within the list of all gliders in all
rules. Gliders are numbered sequentially, beginning with 1. Only certain
iconic gliders are listed.</p>
<p><b>Glider number (rule)</b> allows for searching for specific gliders in
David Eppstein&rsquo;s glider repository, within the currently-selected rule.
Gliders are numbered sequentially in each rule, beginning with 1. Only certain
iconic gliders are listed.</p>
<p><b>Header name</b> allows for searching for patterns within specific groups
within the pattern database. Header names contain digits, hyphens, and
lower-case letters. Case is ignored. All other punctuation is ignored. These
groups correspond to how data is arranged in various articles elsewhere on this
site, and on how data is arranged in the internal database. This is normally
only done for internal purposes, or for specialized pattern groups that
aren&rsquo;t easily qualified by category, period, and population. Sometimes,
the name is intuitive (e.g. <i>p3-lg</i> is period 3 oscillators with
populations &ge;35, <i>pp2-12</i> is 12-bit period 2 pseudo-oscillators,
<i>ss-2o5</i> is 2<i>c</i>/5 orthogonal spaceships, and <i>34-p8</i> is period 8
oscillators in B34/S34.)</p>
<p><b>Hickerson Rotor Descriptor</b> (HRD) allows for searching oscillators
and similar patterns by the signature of their rotors.</p>
<p><b>LifeWiki page</b> allows for searching for patterns that refer to a
particular page on the LifeWiki. Wiki names contain digits, lower- and
upper-case letters, underscores (in place of spaces), and certain punctuation
characters, including hyphens, apostrophes, $, and parentheses.</p>
<p><b>LIS name</b> allows for searching for a pattern by its LIS encoding,
which is the format used by Niemiec&rsquo;s still-life search program, and is
the format used by the database that runs this site and its search engine.
This is only well-defined for patterns with sizes up to 223&times;223.</p>
<p><b>Neighborhoods</b> allows for searching for all patterns that work
within a certain group of related outer totalistic rules. If you enter a
string of the form <em>B<i>aa-bb</i>/S<i>cc-dd</i></em>, only patterns
that require birth conditions <i>aa</i> but not <i>bb</i> and survival
conditions <i>cc</i> but not <i>dd</i>, are matched. Conditions that
are neither required nor forbidden may be either present or absent
(e.g. <b>B3/S23</b> matches <b>B3/S23</b>, <b>B3/S238</b>, <b>B36/S23</b>,
<b>B38/S23</b>, and <b>B38/S238</b>).</p>
<p><b>Pattern name</b> allows for searching for a pattern by its
human-readable pattern name. Letters, digits, periods, $, and &uuml; are used.
Case is ignored. All other punctuation is ignored. The phrases <em>with</em>
and <em>w/</em> are considered equivalent.</p>
<p><b>SOF name</b> allows for searching for a pattern by its SOF encoding,
which is the canonical format used on
<a class="x" target="_blank" href="http://pentadecathlon.com">pentadecathlon.com</a>. This is well
defined for still-lifes, oscillators, and spaceships. It is also well defined
for pseudo-objects, quasi-objects, and constellations containing these,
although pentadecathlon.com does not currently track them. This is
not defined for constellations containing patterns of different
velocities, methuselahs, or growing patterns. SOF names contain
digits, lower- and upper-case letters, and any of the punctuation
characters +-:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\]^_`{|}~ and ending with a period (which may
be omitted, since it is always present in the format, so it is assumed).</p>
<p><b>Pattern image</b> allows for searching for a pattern by its image.
Because this image is usually large or two-dimensional, the entry field
for the pattern is placed at the bottom of the search criteria. The pattern
can be in one of several different input formats. You can specify an image
format, or select Auto, in which case the format is automatically detected.
Currently supported are APG, Cells, Life 1.05, Life 1.06, LIS, RLE, SOF.
If the format is unknown, Cells is assumed. If this field is empty,
the search is not constrained by pattern image. To explicitly search for an
empty pattern, enter at least a comment or an empty cell. The window is
initially tall enough to enter two lines of text, but you can adjust the
window height to be larger, if desired.</p>
<p>The easiest way to enter a pattern is to copy and paste it from another
Life program like Golly. Pattern orientation is not important. Phase is not
important for oscillators, pseudo-oscillators, quasi-oscillators, spaceships,
pseudo-spaceships, quasi-spaceships, or constellations. Extra spaces outside
the pattern are ignored. The exact pattern must be specified (e.g. oscillators
and spaceships must include their sparks). For methuselahs or growing patterns,
the database only stores a small number of generations, so it may be more
useful to search for them by category, as the lists of patterns in those
categories are small.</p>
<p>A pattern can also be entered manually. Spaces, punctuation and
line-drawing characters (- + and |) are treated as dead cells, and all others
as living cells. Avoid using # characters at at the start of a line, or !
character anywhere, as these may cause the pattern to be interpreted as one
of the special file formats.</p>
<p>When using Cells, RLE, or Life 1.05 formats (but not Life 1.06, APG,
LIS, or SOF), the ? character has special meaning. Cells indicated by ? are
wildcards &mdash; they match either living or dead cells. This allows one to
search for specific pieces of patterns (e.g. patterns with an eater tail on
one side, patterns with mold rotors, etc.) Note, however, that using wildcards
to match pattern images is extremely time-consuming. It is generally faster to
combine such wildcards with other constraints, especially when searching for
oscillators or spaceships (e.g. when searching for patterns that contain mold
rotors, one should also also specify period=4, or possibly period&ge;4, if one
also wants to include period-multiplied oscillators).</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>The search results are displayed as a list of patterns
<span id="res">or a stamp page showing images of patterns</span>
below the search criteria table. Clicking on a pattern&rsquo;s name
<span id="click">or image</span> selects it and displays detailed information
about it. If the search finds exactly one result (which usually happens when one
enters an image, or a pattern by name with no wildcards), that result is
automatically selected.</p>
<p>The List view shows several columns of data. A column is shown for every
search criterion that is selected, whether it contributes to the search or not.
(E.g. to display the Heat of all patterns, select the Heat criterion, and
set it to <em>Any</em>.). A column is also included for the criterion used for
sorting. In any case, columns are always included for Minimum population,
Period, Pattern name(s), and Image.</p>
<p>In the List view, clicking on a column heading changes the sort order,
and clicking on a second time reverses the sort direction. If results
from multiple rules are shown, clicking on a rule&rsquo;s heading
collapses the results for that rule, allowing easier access to results from
other rules (especially if a large number of results have been found).
Clicking on it a second time re-displays the hidden results.</p>
<p>Clicking on the pattern name or image selects the pattern, and displays
details about that pattern in the table below. In addition, clicking on some
other fields in the table have other effects:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Clicking on Category goes to the main category page for patterns in
	that category, or for non-Life rules, the section for such
	patterns.</li>
    <li>For Life, clicking on the population goes to the page for all
	patterns with that population.</li>
    <li>Oscillators and spaceships with glide symmetry show period and also the
	number of times the pattern recurs. For example, the Queen Bee shows a
	period of 30(/2), which means its period is 30, its modulus is 15, and
	it recurs twice during its cycle. Clicking on the period goes to the
	page for the main category page for patterns with that period, or for
	non-Life rules, the section for such patterns. This only works for
	still-lifes, pseudo-still-lifes, quasi-still-lifes, oscillators, 
	pseudo-oscillators, quasi-oscillators, and constellations,
	and also methuselahs in Life.</li>
    <li>Clicking on the velocity goes to the section for spaceships
	with that velocity</li>
    <li>For Life, clicking on Gliders goes to the page for patterns that
	cost that number of gliders (2-7 or &ge;100), or other groups that are
	tracked (i.e. 1 glider/bit, &gt; 1 glider/bit, partial, unknown).</li>
    <li>For Life, clicking on Gl./bit goes to the page for patterns that
	cost that number of gliders (i.e. 1 glider/bit, &gt; 1 glider/bit,
	partial, unknown).</li>
    <li>Clicking on Freq. or Rarity brings up the page for common objects.</li>
    <li>For spaceships, clicking on Glider # or Gl. # (rule) brings up the
	Glider Repository page for all rules or this rule, respectively.</li>
    <li>Clicking on APG or SOF name brings up the Catagolue or pentadecathlon
	page for this pattern, respectively.</li>
    <li>Clicking on Header brings up the corresponding article on the page
	associated with the related category (or rule page, if not Life).</li>
    <li>Clicking on File brings up the synthesis file.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><div id="stamp">In the Stamp view, clicking on a pattern selects it, and
displays details about that pattern in the table below. Clicking on the top or
bottom left corners of the stamp behave respectively as <em>Page Up</em> or
<em>Page Down</em> to scroll through multiple results. Clicking on the bottom
right corner opens an RLE file of the stamp page itself. Below the stamp is
a standard stamp navigation bar with the following buttons:
<ul>
    <li><b>&uArr;</b> and <b>&dArr;</b> respectively go to the top and bottom of
	the page.</li>
    <li><b>PNG</b> opens the stamp page image.</li>
    <li><b>RLE</b> opens the RLE image of the stamp page.</li>
    <li><b>APG</b>, <b>LIS</b>, and <b>SOF</b> return lists of all search
	results in the selected format.</li>
</ul></div></p>
<p>If there are too many results to fit on one page, navigation buttons are
available above and below the search results to allow scrolling through the
different pages.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>When a result pattern has been selected, its details are displayed below
the search results. If a search only finds one pattern, that pattern is
automatically selected. If a pattern search yields no results, the entered
pattern may be shown with some information deduced about it, but most
properties will not be shown.</p>
<p>The information is displayed in a two-column table, with property names
on the left and property values on the right. Clicking on a property name
usually loads a page for that property in general, while clicking on the
property value usually loads a page for that property value in particular.
Properties that are unknown or not applicable are omitted. The following
properties may be displayed:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><b>Rule</b> is the rule that applies to this pattern.
	Clicking on the rule opens the page for that rule.</li>
    <li><b>Name(s)</b> is the name or names given to this pattern.</li>
    <li><b>Smallest box</b> is the box for the smallest phase of the pattern,
	or the smallest initial phase for methuselahs.</li>
    <li><b>Largest box</b> is the box for the largest phase of the pattern,
	or the largest census phase for methuselahs.</li>
    <li><b>Hull</b> is the box that includes all phases of the pattern,
	or all census phases for methuselahs. (Each of these boxes includes
	width &times; height, &#9646; area, &#9647; circumference, &#9026;
	diagonal, squareness (i.e. height/width));</li>
    <li><b>Population</b> shows the minimum, maximum, and average populations.
	For methuselahs, minimum population is for the smallest predecessor, and
	average and maximum populations are for the census. Clicking on this
	opens a page for all patterns of that population.</li>
    <li><b>Symmetry</b> shows the pattern&rsquo;s symmetry and glide symmetry.</li>
    <li><b>Category</b> shows the pattern&rsquo;s category. Clicking on this opens
	a page for all patterns of that category. If other sub-categories are
	appropriate, they are also listed here. (E.g. constellations may also be
	quasi-still-lifes; oscillators may also be flip-flops.)</li>
    <li><b>Density</b> shows the minimum, maximum, and average densities,
	i.e. ratios of corresponding populations and influence.</li>
    <li><b>Frequency</b> shows frequency of occurrence for common objects.</li>
    <li><b>Gliders</b> shows the minimum number of gliders required to
	synthesize the pattern. Clicking on this opens a page for all patterns
	with a similar cost in gliders.</li>
    <li><b>Heat</b> shows the pattern&rsquo;s heat.</li>
    <li><b>Influence</b> shows the pattern&rsquo;s influence.</li>
    <li><b>Period</b> shows the pattern&rsquo;s period, and also modulus, if
	different. Clicking on this opens a page for all patterns with the
	same period.</li>
    <li><b>Rule(s)</b> shows the range of rules in which this pattern works.
	Note that this does not include rules where the pattern behaves
	similarly but has some phases with trivial differences.</li>

<h2>Search for still-life</h2>
<p>This section lets you search for still-lifes or difficult still-lifes in
Life by number.</p>
<p>First, select the still-life size from the left drop-down list, from
4&hellip;24. Next, select the type of search from the middle list, either .
(for still-life) or # (for difficult still-life). Finally, select the still-life
number into the right text box and press Search. If the selected still-life has
an associated synthesis file, that file is opened.</p>
<p>Still-lifes have numbers beginning with 1 (e.g. 14.1&hellip;619). All
syntheses up to 14 bits are available.</p>
<p>Difficult still-lifes are defined from 14&hellip;18 bits. From
14&hellip;16 bits, they have numbers beginning with 1 (i.e. 14#1&hellip;4,
15#1&hellip;18, 16#1&hellip;94), and from 17&hellip;18 bits, they have numbers
beginning with 100 (i.e. 17#100&hellip;398 and 18#100&hellip;790). All

<h2>Search for rule</h2>
<p>This section lets you search for outer totalistic and non-totalistic rules
based on their arrangements of neighbors.</p>
<p>This section displays a cellular automata rule in four formats. Any change
made in any one of the fields is immediately reflected in all the others.</p>
<p>At the top is a graphical map of all possible neighborhoods. The left half
shows birth conditions, while the right half shows survival conditions. In each
half, the numbers on the left indicate outer totalistic neighbors, while the
images beside them show individual non-totalistic sub-neighborhoods. Clicking on
a sub-neighborhood toggles inclusion of that sub-neighborhood, while clicking on
a number toggles inclusion of all sub-neighborhoods that are subsets of one
outer totalistic neighborhood. (For example, clicking on the grey 1 toggles
birth on 1 neighbor in any position, while clicking on image beside it toggles
birth on one diagonal neighbor.)</p>
<p>Below this is a text table of all possible neighborhoods. This is in the same
format as the graphical map. Each neighborhood is shown in white if it is not
selected, and green if it is selected. Outer totalistic neighborhoods for which
some subsets are selected but others aren&rsquo;t selected are shown in yellow.
There are also three additional buttons at the top right. <em>Undo</em> reverses
the action of the most recent button click. <em>Moore</em> and <em>Hex</em>
switch between 8-cell Moore neighborhood and 6-cell hexagonal neighborhood.</p>
<p>In the middle is a RLE-file rule string, as supported by Golly or other Life
programs. Most Life programs accept outer totalistic rule strings. Golly also
accepts non-totalistic strings in the Moore neighborhood, and outer totalistic
strings in the hexagonal neighborhood. (It does not yet accept non-totalistic
strings in the hexagonal neighborhood; to use such rules with Golly, one must
currently copy the rule table into a file, place it in Golly&rsquo;s <em>Rules</em>
directory, and use Golly&rsquo;s Rule Loader to load it.) Golly also supports 4-cell
Von Neumann neighborhoods, but this search tool does not, as it only supports
rules with two states, and Von Neumann rules need more than two states to be
interesting.</p>
<p>The rule string is typically of the form <em>B<i>bbb</i>/S<i>sss</i></em>,
where <i>bbb</i> is a list of 0 or more digits representing birth conditions,
and <i>sss</i> is a list of 0 or more digits representing survival conditions.
For non-totalistic rules, each digit may be followed by one or more letters
that describe specific sub-neighborhoods to be included. If most are included,
it is easier to specify the digits, a minus sign, and a list of
sub-neighborhoods to be excluded instead. Finally, an <em>H</em> at the end
indicates that a hexagonal neighborhood is used, rather than the default
Moore neighborhood. More details about this format can be found in
Golly&rsquo;s documentation.</p>
<p>On input, this field has a fair bit of flexibility. Letter case is ignored.
The / may be omitted. The digits and sub-neighborhood letters may be specified
in any order, and need not be unique. The legacy format of
<em><i>sss</i>/<i>bbb</i></em> is also supported. Once any change is made in
either of the two rule tables above, this rule string is re-generated in its
canonical form.</p>
<p>Directly below the RLE rule is a MAP rule that describes the 512 possible
Moore neighborhoods or 128 possible hexagonal neighborhoods, encoded in base64
encoding. (This field is read-only, and cannot be used to convert MAP rules
into RLE rule strings.)</p>
<p>At the bottom is a rule table, suitable for use by Golly&rsquo;s Rule Loader.
To use this table, copy it to a text file, and save it in Golly&rsquo;s
<em>Rules</em> directory. (This field is read-only, and cannot be used to
convert Golly rule tables into RLE rule strings.) The description of the format
used for this table can be found in Golly&rsquo;s documentation.</p>
<p>Below the rule string is a link to the
<a class="p" href="https://catagolue.hatsya.com/">Catagolue</a> search results
for the selected rule. (This page will be empty, if no searches for that rule
have yet been performed).</p>
<p>If a rule is outer totalistic, an additional link is provided to David
Eppstein&rsquo;s glider repository, showing all a list of spaceships listed there
for the selected rule. Note that that list is merely representative, rather than
exhaustive. In rules that have been studied extensively (such as Life), there
may be many additional known spaceships that are not listed there.</p>

<h2>Search Catagolue</h2>
<p>This section lets you search Catagolue.</p>
<p>In the first line, select the type of search to perform:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><b>Attribute</b>: This is similar to Object, but displays any additional
	attribute information associated with a particular object.</li>
    <li><b>Census</b>: This is the most commonly selected search. It provides
	census information about searches for a rule, a symmetry within a rule,
	or a category of objects within a symmetry result. From a category,
	you can get a list of objects found in that category.</li> 
    <li><b>Haul</b>: This provides a list of hauls related to a particular
	rule and symmetry. You must specify whether you want to see hauls
	that have not yet been committed, hauls that has not yet been verified,
	or hauls that have been verified. You can also limit the list to hauls
	submitted by a particular user.</li>
    <li><b>Home</b>: This shows the Catagolue home page.</li>
    <li><b>Object</b>: By entering an apgcode for an object, you can get a
	list of all soups found that contain that object. You can also search
	via the apgsearch of a pattern found by a previous Pattern Search.</li>
    <li><b>Object Count</b>: This is like Census, but just shows the number of
	objects found in each category in an editable text format arranged as
	a CSV table.</li>
    <li><b>Object List</b>: This is like Census, but just shows a list of all
	objects found in an editable text format as a CSV table.</li>
    <li><b>Rules</b>: This points to the Catagolue rules page.</li>
    <li><b>Statistics</b>: This shows statistics about searches in the Life
	rule.</li>
    <li><b>Synthesis List</b> and <b>Synthesis Table</b>: These display census
	results for a specific pattern type within a given rule. These are
	respectively similar to Object List and Census, except the patterns are
	sorted in order of decreasing synthesis cost, in three groups: first,
	patterns without syntheses (showing a cost of infinity), objects, and
	non-objects (including pseudo-objects, quasi-objects, and
	constellations).</li>
    <li><b>User</b>: This shows information about contributions by a specific
	user.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The other lines specify other search criteria, and are only shown if they
apply to the search being performed.</p>
<p>If you are performing a User or Haul search, you should enter the
user&rsquo;s nickname or email address in the Name field.</p>
<p>If you are performing an Object or Attribute search, you should select
<em>Here</em> from the drop box and enter the APG code of the object. If you
had previously used the pattern search to find the object, select <em>Pattern
search</em> from the drop box and the result of that search will be used
instead.</p>
<p>If you are performing a Census, Object, Object List, Object Count,
Synthesis List, or Synthesis Table search, you must select a rule from the
drop down list. If the rule you want is not on the list, select
<em>Other</em> and type in a rule. You can select <em>From Search
rule&hellip;</em> to use the rule determined by the Search Rule section above.
You can select <em>Any</em> in a Census search, in which case a list of the
most recently searched rules is shown.</p>
<p>If you are performing a Census, Object, Object List or Object Count
search, you must select a symmetry from the drop down list. If you want
to select a non-standard symmetry, select <em>Other</em> and type in the
symmetry. You can select <em>Any</em> in a Census search, in which case a
list of all common symmetries is shown.</p>
<p>If you are performing a Census search, you can select a date, by selecting
year, month, and day from drop down lists. If you specify a date, statistics
are displayed as of that date. If you select <em>Any</em>, the most recent
statistics are displayed.</p>
<p>If you are performing a Census search, you should select an object type
from the drop down list. If you select <em>Any</em>, a list of all categories
for which objects have been found is shown. If you select a category, you
must provide additional information:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>For Still-lifes, you must specify the population.</li>
    <li>For oscillators and spaceships, you must specify the period.</li>
    <li>For puffers and guns, you must specify the repeat factor. (This is
	usually the modulus, but is always a fraction of the period.)</li>
    <li>The other categories (e.g. over-sized patterns, growing patterns, and
	pathological patterns) lump all objects into a single list, so they
	do not require any additional information.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>At the bottom of the table is a link to the desired Catagolue search results,
if sufficient information has been supplied, or an error message indicating
what information is missing.</p>

<a id="tips" name="tips"></a>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>Some helpful search tips:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Normally, the list of patterns searched include all patterns on this
	site that occur in detailed object lists, currently 14880 items.
	You can also optionally search through around 107058 additional items
	that appear on expanded object stamp pages (i.e. those that include
	2000 or more patterns, without syntheses, 1000 per page). To avoid
	long delays during page loads, this option is on a separate page,
	<a class="i" target="lifesrch" href="lifxsrch.htm">Expanded search</a>.
	On that version of the search page, the inclusion of these additional
	patterns can be enabled by checking the check-box <em>Include expanded
	object lists</em>. If this is disabled, the search will be as limited
	as (and as fast as) the regular search.
	<ul>
	    <li>Normal search includes all Life still-lifes up to 15 bits,
		pseudo-still-lifes up to 16 bits, period 2 oscillators up to
		18 bits, and period 2 pseudo-oscillators up to 18 bits.</li>
	    <li>Expanded search includes all Life still-lifes and pseudo-still-lifes
		up to 18 bits (and symmetric ones up to 24 bits), and period
		2 oscillators and pseudo-oscillators up to 21 bits.</li>
	    <li>All other object types, and all other rules, are the same in
		both kinds of search.</li>
	</ul></li>
    <li>If you get too many results, try to narrow down the search. When
	searching by name, use multiple wildcards. (For example, when looking
	for snakes on candlefrobras, try <em>*snake*frob*</em> rather than just
	<em>*frob*</em>. It can also be helpful to narrow the search by
	specifying a period, a range for minimum population, and/or a velocity
	for spaceships.</li>
    <li>If you get too few results, or none at all, try removing one search
	criterion at a time until some results are found.</li>
    <li>Four properties (minimum population, period, name, and image) are always
	displayed in the search results table. Other properties are only
	displayed if you supply search criteria for them, or if you specifically
	sort based on those properties. To include other properties in the table
	without actually constraining them, enable a constraint and set it to
	<em>Any</em>.</li>
    <li>Search speed is increased if you specify specific rules, categories,
	populations, periods, or velocities, as these criteria automatically
	reject entire groups of patterns without needing to examine each
	one separately. Note that searching by pattern image also filters Life
	still-lifes, pseudo-still-lifes, and quasi-still-lifes by implicitly
	selecting <em>Minimum population &ge; (population of the entered image,
	assuming all wildcards are dead)</em> and <em>Maximum population &le;
	(population of the entered image, assuming all wildcards are
	alive)</em>. The fastest search is to search by name for one specific
	still-life, e.g. 12.121; such searches should be virtually
	instantaneous.</li>
    <li>Text representations (i.e. Apg, LIS, and SOF names) are not stored in
	the database, but each pattern&rsquo;s representation is calculated the first
	time it is needed. Thus, searches by name (e.g. <em>Apg begins with
	xp3_</em> can initially take a long time, unless other constraints are
	also supplied. Apg search names also contain implicit constraints for
	category, period, and population, unless complicated names are used
	(e.g. anything other than <em>is</em>, e.g. wildcards, multiple names,
	exclusions). Searching apg search names by image, however, is faster
	than a normal image search, because the apg search name also implicitly
	filtered by category and period.</li>
    <li>Image search with wildcards is extremely time-consuming, so it is
	usually a good idea to provide as many other known criteria as possible
	(e.g. category, period).</li>
    <li>It is easy to convert from one Life file format to another. Simply use
	the image search, paste the input file (which can be in any supported
	format) into the image text box, press Search, then use the Export function
	to export it into any other supported format.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Sometimes, results can be correct, although they may seem confusing or
counter-intuitive:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>When entering numeric expressions, the * for multiplication can
	sometimes be omitted, but not always; omitting it can sometimes yield
	unexpected results. It can always be omitted before
	<i>&pi;</i>, <i>&tau;</i> and <i>&straightphi;</i> (e.g. 2<i>&pi;</i> is 2*<i>&pi;</i>).
	It can be omitted before <i>e</i> (e.g. 3e^2 is 3*<i>e</i>&sup2;), but
	not if it&rsquo;s followed by + or &ndash;, as that indicates scientific
	notation (e.g. 4e-2 = 0.04, not 4*<i>e</i>-2).
	It can never be omitted with &radic;
	(e.g. 4&radic;2 = fourth root of 2, not 4*&radic;2). It may also never
	be omitted in any other cases not mentioned here.</li>
    <li>In numeric expressions, implicit multiplication has a higher binding
	precedence than exponentiation. Thus, 4<i>&pi;</i>&sup2; and 4<i>&pi;</i>^2
	are (4*<i>&pi;</i>)&sup2; rather than 4*(<i>&pi;</i>&sup2;). This may be
	counter-intuitive (and is, in this example, incorrect) but it is not
	likely to be fixed soon.</li>
    <li>The displayed form of an object is the base canonical form that
	included in the object database. This may differ from what is entered
	via image search. In most cases, width &ge; height, but for moving
	patterns (e.g. spaceships, pseudo-spaceships, quasi-spaceships, and
	puffers), movement is always in the up and/or left directions, and
	velocity up &ge; velocity left.</li>
    <li>Adding additional constraints can sometimes produce <em>more</em>
	results rather than less. This often happens when one constraint
	renders another meaningless, causing it to be ignored. For example,
	when searching for objects with velocity &gt; 0, there are hundreds
	of objects (spaceships and puffers), yet when the search is also
	restricted to only still-lifes, there are thousands of results.
	This is because velocity is meaningless for still-lifes, so it is
	ignored, and all still-lifes are found.</li>
    <li>Many properties (such as heat and volatility) are formally defined only
	for periodic patterns, such as oscillators (and, implicitly, still-lifes
	that have heat and volatility zero). Here, these definitions are
	extended to other kinds of objects, by being treated asymptotically, as
	limits as time goes to infinity (e.g.
	lim<sub><i>x</i>&rarr;&infin;</sub> (statistics from generations
	<i>xp</i>&hellip;2<i>xp</i>-1, where <i>p</i> is the pattern&rsquo;s period,
	or 1 if the period is not regular). This allows the definitions to be
	seamlessly extended to many other classes of objects:
	<ul>
	    <li>Spaceships are completely volatile (e.g. heat is finite, and
		volatility and strict volatility are 1).</li>
	    <li>Heat and volatility of guns are dominated by their outputs
		(e.g. heat is infinite; volatility is that of their
		outputs, e.g. 1).</li>
	    <li>Heat and volatility of puffers and wick-stretchers are dominated
		by their outputs (e.g. heat is that of the puffer if output is
		all still-lifes, and infinite otherwise; volatility is that of
		the output).</li>
	    <li>Similarly, heat and volatility of breeders are dominated by
		their guns or puffers, and they in turn by their outputs.
		(e.g. heat is always infinite (e.g. &infin; for MMS breeders,
		and &infin;&sup2; for all others).</li>
	    <li>Temperature for infinitely-expanding patterns can be meaningful
		even if heat is not (e.g. for guns, puffers, and breeders, it
		will be that of their dominating outputs.)</li>
	    <li>Methuselahs are dominated by their final census.</li>
	    <li>Irregular infinitely-expanding patterns (typically in rules
		other than Life) have infinite heat and volatility, zero
		strict volatility, and indeterminate temperature.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul></p>

<a id="issues" name="issues"></a>
<h2>Known issues</h2>
<p><ul>
    <li>Heat and volatility may be incorrect for methuselahs and growing patterns,
	and is meaningless for not quite stable objects.</li>
    <li>Most periodic patterns can be found by image search in any phase.
	However, some large patterns are only listed by their main phases. These
	include methuselahs and expanding patterns (guns, puffers, wick-stretchers
	and breeders).</li>
    <li>Huge patterns frequently lack accurate information about certain
	statistics, such as pattern image, average and maximum population, heat,
	large bounding box, hull, etc. (The only patterns currently affected are
	the <a class="i" href="exotic.htm">huge spaceships</a> and the
	<a class="i" href="puff.htm#puff-geminoid">Geminoid
	replicators</a>.)</li>
    <li>Wildcard image searches may take an extremely long time, especially if
	the image being searched for is fairly large, and there are no other
	constraints. It is best to apply as many other constraints as possible
	to first narrow the search.</li>
    <li>Search by image does not actually analyze a pattern&rsquo;s
	behavior (other than to check if it is stable), so if a pattern is not
	in the list of known patterns, most of its properties will not be
	available. In particular, the associated Catagolue link will only be
	correct if the pattern is a still-life. If it is anything else,
	its Catagolue link assumes a prefix of <em>xp0_</em>, for generic
	unstable pattern, unless a specific search category has been
	selected, and an additional constraint (i.e. population for
	still-lifes, pseudo-still-lifes, quasi-lifes, or constellations
	containing the same; period for oscillators, pseudo-oscillators,
	quasi-oscillators, spaceships, pseudo-spaceships, quasi-spaceships,
	or constellations containing these).</li>

<h2>Browser issues</h2>
<p><ul>
    <li>Some browsers display text more widely than others, which can
	sometimes cause entries in tables to wrap around.</li>
    <li id="opera">Opera version 9 does not resize the pattern image properly.
	Also, in the list view, when a large number of results are found (for
	example, around 3000 or more), the sort order can be unpredictable.</li>
    <li id="nocan">Older browsers (such as this one) that lack support for HTML
	canvases do not support the stamp view of search results, thumbnail
	images in the list view of search results, or pattern images below
	search details.)</li>
    <li>On some browsers, re-loading the page resets all form data. On some
	others, form data is preserved. In any case, search results are not
	preserved.</li>

<h2>Privacy policy</h2>
<p>All searching is performed entirely in the browser; no information is sent
to any server, so no data is collected for any purpose whatsoever. (Not that it
likely that anyone would consider Life patterns to be highly sensitive personal
information anyway.) Some search results provide links that go to other sites
like Catagolue or David Eppstein&rsquo;s glider repository. Following those links
to other sites may be subject to those sites&rsquo;s privacy policies.</p>
